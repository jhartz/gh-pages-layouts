<div class="section-msg">
    <p><strong>Support for MP4 Downloader has been discontinued.</strong></p>

    <p>I don't have the time anymore to keep up with all the breaking changes that Mozilla is
    making in add-on development for Firefox, in addition to reacting to changes in YouTube,
    Dailymotion, and Vimeo that affect video downloading. Since Mozilla dropped support for
    traditional add-ons in November 2017, MP4 Downloader has stopped working entirely in new
    versions of Firefox.</p>

    <p>The codebase has been left in the middle of a complete rewrite (see the Source Code section
    of the <a href="/mp4downloader/development.html">Development page</a>), although this rewrite
    is not anywhere close to what is required to support new versions of Firefox. That codebase,
    and this website, are left here for archival purposes.</p>

    <p>To all MP4 Downloader fans, thanks for many years of support.</p>

<div class="section-msg">
    <p><strong>Support for MP4 Downloader has been discontinued.</strong></p>

    <p>I don't have the time anymore to keep up with all the breaking changes that Mozilla is
    making in add-on development for Firefox, in addition to reacting to changes in YouTube,
    Dailymotion, and Vimeo that affect video downloading. The current version of MP4 Downloader has
    some features that are broken because of this, and once Mozilla drops traditional add-ons in
    favor of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions" target="_blank">WebExtensions</a>
    (something that I, and
    <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/#comments" target="_blank">many</a>
    <a href="http://fasezero.com/" target="_blank">others</a>,
    don't agree with), MP4 Downloader will stop working entirely. (This change is planned for
    Firefox 57, which will be released in November 2017.)</p>

    <p>The codebase has been left in the middle of a complete rewrite (see the Source Code section
    of the <a href="/mp4downloader/development.html">Development page</a>). That codebase, and this
    website, are left here for archival purposes.</p>
